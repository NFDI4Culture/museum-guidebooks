But this is not publishing in data repositories.\nWelcome to ‘Open Museum’! If museums made deposits of open data of what’s on show - then their visitors could make ‘play lists’ of their favourite works and share them online.\nThe ‘Open Museum’ pitch is that the public take part in this cataloguing and a Citizen Science Experience.\nThe prototype ‘Open Museum Guidebooks’ has outlined the idea and is sharing the ‘how to’ model using Wikibase as a foundation. We believe all the infrastructure is already out there and with luck museums back catalogues could be online in no time (famous last words).\n–\nProject inspired by the 1700s database - Corpus Johann Joachim Winckelmanns (1717–1768).
